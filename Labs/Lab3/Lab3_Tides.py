#The Large Magellanic Cloud is at a distance of 50 kpc from the Galactic Center. 
#It is observed to have a stellar disk that extends to a radius of at least 18.5 kpc.

#In this lab we will determine
#the minimum mass required for the LMC so that it maintains the observed radius 
#in the face of the Milky Way's tidal field. 

#Part A
#We define the mass profile of the Milky Way using a Hernquist profile.
#$\rho(r) =  \frac{M_{halo}}{2\pi} \frac{a}{r(r+a)^3} \qquad M(r) =  \frac{M_{halo} r^2}{(a+r)^2}$ 

#1
#Create a function `hernquist_mass` that returns the dark matter halo mass at a given radius in units of solar mass.
#This function should take as input:  the distance from the Galactic center $r$, the scale radius $a$, and the halo mass $M_{halo}$.
# For the Hernquist scale radius for the Milky Way, use the default value of $a=60$ kpc. 
# For $M_{halo}$ use your answer for the total mass of the simulated Milky Way you computed in Homework 3 as the default value (in units of 1e12). 




#2
#Compute the total mass of the Milky Way within 50 kpc, including its baryonic components (Dark Matter + Bulge + Disk). Use your answers from Homework 3 for the Bulge and Disk Masses. 
#Store this as a variable called `mass_MW50`.





#Part B
#The Jacobi Radius for a satellite on a circular orbit about an extended host, where 
#the host is assumed to be well modeled as an isothermal sphere halo:
#$R_j = r  \bigg( \frac{M_{sat}}{2 M_{host}(<r)} \bigg)^{1/3}$
#The Isothermal Sphere approximation is not a bad one within 50 kpc.
#Note also that the LMC is not on a circular orbit, but it is very close to its pericentric approach, where the velocity is all in the tangential component. So this isn't a terrible approximation either. 

#1
#Create a function called `jacobi_mass` that returns the total mass of a satellite galaxy in units of Msun, 
#such that it has a given size 
#Do this by rearranging the Jacobi Radius equation to solve for the satellite mass. 



#2 
#Determine the minimum total mass of the LMC needed to maintain its radius of 18.5 kpc in the face of the Milky Way's tidal 
#field at its current distance of 50 kpc. Store this as a variable called `LMC_jacobiM`.


#3
#Recall that, ignoring centrifugal forces and assuming the host is a point mass, the tidal radius is given as :
#$r_{tide} = r\left (\frac{m_{sat}}{4M_{host} } \right)^{1/3} $
#Create a function to determine the total mass the must LMC possess to have a disk with radius 18.5 kpc.
#The function should take as input, the current size of the satellite (kpc), this distance to the host (kpc) and the mass of the host (in Msun)
#Use the function to determine the needed LMC mass and store it as a variable called `LMC_tidalM`. 


#4
#a) Compare `LMC_tidalM` to the calculation using the Jacobi Radius.

#b)How does the total mass of the LMC compare to its stellar mass (M$_\ast = 3 \times 10^9$ M$_\odot$)? 


#Part C: Consistency Check
#The dynamical mass of the LMC at any radius can be determined by assuming a flat rotation curve.  "Dynamical mass" means mass needed to explain the rotation curve. 
#$V_c^2 = \frac{G M}{r} = constant$ 
#The rotation curve of the LMC is observed to flatten at a value of 91.7 +/- 18.8 km/s  (van der Marel & Kallivayalil 2014 ApJ 781)
#Create a function called `dyn_mass` that takes as input Vc (km/s) and distance to from the center of the galaxy (r) and returns the maximal dynamical mass in Msun. 
#$G$ = 4.4985e-6 kpc$^3$/Gyr$^2$/M$_\odot$
 
#1  
#Compute the dynamical mass enclosed by the LMC within the observed radius. Store it as a variable called `LMC_dynM`. 


#2
#Is `LMC_dynM` consistent with `LMC_jacobiM`, the minimum mass needed to explain the observed radius of the LMC given the tidal field of the MW? If not, how can the numbers be reconciled?
